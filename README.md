## Description

Hello! This is my first Python project and I use the gradio framework for this. You will know more about this project, when you try this project on your own. This is a project, where I make an 'imitation' of a prompted Chatbot. I initially make this project as a framework testing for my Bachelor Project, where I can try to use all the components and features in Gradio, and finally I decided to post this into my GitHub. So, this project is just for fun :) I hope you can enjoy 'chatting' with the bot.
To see the code, changelog, and documentation of this project, please check out my GitHub under: https://github.com/yosephinestwn
